## Exercise 5.1

Let $T_1$ represent the result of the first test and $T_2$ represent the result of the second test.

Then P(Has disease | $T_1 = +, T_2 = -$) = [1-P($T_1 = +$ | Has disease)] x P(Has disease | $T_1 = +$) / [[1-P($T_1 = +$ | Has disease)]] x P(Has disease | $T_1 = +$) + [1-P($T_1 = +$ | Doesn't have disease)] x (1-P(Has disease | $T_1 = +$))] =

```{r}
true_positive <- 0.99
false_positive <- 0.05
posterior <- 0.019

((1-true_positive) * posterior)/(((1-true_positive) * posterior) + ((1-false_positive) * (1-posterior)))

```

Ran out of time, saving for next week :(
